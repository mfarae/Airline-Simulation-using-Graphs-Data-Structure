# Airline-Simulation-using-Graphs-Data-Structure
In the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I wrote this code to do some practice of Depth-First Search and Breadth First Search. All logic is implemented using the bare minimum of STL required and it is accomplished by pure C++ data types and self-defined classes.
